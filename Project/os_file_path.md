## Create a main OS
This logic creates a Operating System
from inside the shell script OPT command

- import a compiler
  > perl compiler for readonly logic
  = perl shell and python
  <br>
- use selected features from compiler
- import logic from INPUT

```pl
import os_system

use os_system
use warnings
use strict

print "working with files from os_system main directory."
return 0

else script_OPT = $Local_Variable

else goto: CONDITIONAL AVAILABLE

listed arguments console commnad
workspace VM smart contract blockchain network

```
## NOTES / Program FTL
This program is about connecting the compiler to a new variable file
for readonly configurations and source code optimization edits.
